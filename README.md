# EquaMap

Inspired by a former math based programming language I made called [Equa](https://github.com/sty00A4/equa),
EquaMap extend Equa in the way of introducing *maps*. It is written like you would write math, of course being limited by
a computers character set and one dimensional text display, with some additional syntax to make the language
more fit for computers.
